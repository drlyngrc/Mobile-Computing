# Mobile Computing Course - Android Studio Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Mobile Computing course. This repository contains various projects and practice exercises I completed while learning mobile app development using Android Studio and Java.

## Overview

This course focuses on the fundamentals of mobile application development, covering topics like:
- Building user interfaces using XML and Java
- Data persistence with Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database
- Handling user input and forms

## Repository Structure

- **/ProjectName**: Each folder contains a mobile app project with only the Java source files, layout XML files and other necessary files.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Android Studio**: Primary IDE for Android development
- **Java**: Programming language used
- **XML**: For designing user interfaces
- **Gradle**: For project build management
- **Firebase**: Database used

## Projects

1. **Welcome Message**
   - A simple app that displays wlecome message.
  
2. **Form**
   - A simple form that accepts user input but does not yet have database integration.
   - Features:
       - Basic text input fields for collecting user data
   - Concepts covered: XML UI design, form creation, handling user input

3. **Login and Signup App**
   - A simple app with user authentication screens (Login & Signup) and basic form validation.
   - Features: 
     - Email and password validation
     - UI built with CardView and LinearLayout
   - Concepts covered: XML UI design, activity transitions, form validation using Java

  4. **Calculator**
     - A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations and handles special functions like percent and toggling positive/negative numbers.
     - Features:
       - Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
       - Special functions: percentage, positive/negative, and decimal inputs.
     - Concepts Covered: Handling user input, mathematical operations, and managing UI updates in response to user actions.


## Future Enhancements

- Implementing more complex features like notifications, background services, and data synchronization.
- Exploring app monetization options such as in-app purchases and ads.
